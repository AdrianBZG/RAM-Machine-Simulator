## How to compile?
### Use make inside the /src/ directory. Compilation uses dynamic linking, so only classes that have changed will be compiled, the others will be linked using the object (.o) that's inside ./obj/ directory.

## How to execute?
### The result of the compilation is placed inside /src/compiled folder, with the name RAMmachine, to execute it just use ./src/compiled/RAMmachine from the root directory

## Download source code
